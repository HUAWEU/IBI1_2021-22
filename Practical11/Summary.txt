Results:
The alignment score of human-mouse was 1490, human-random was -351 and mouse-random was -348. 
The percentage of identical amino acids for the comparison between the human and the mouse sequence was 96.5%, 
between the human and the randon sequence was 2.8% and between the mouse and the random sequence was 3.1%.

From the results, we can see that the human sequence was very similar to the mouse sequence, while the similarity 
between the human or mouse and the random sequence was very low. Since humans and rats are both mammals,
and with such similar genetic sequences, I can tell that there is a high probability that humans and rats evolved form a 
common ancestor.
