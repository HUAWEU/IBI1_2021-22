Question: How have new cases and total cases developed over time in 
          Australia?

The line number: 47

Discussion:
 I have plotted both new cases and total cases in Australia over time to 
describe the development of cases in Australia. The plot describes the 
increase of the new cases and total cases,especially around 3.11. Because the
COVID-19 is highly contagious, as the number of cases increases, the speard of 
transmission increases and the number of cases spikes.
