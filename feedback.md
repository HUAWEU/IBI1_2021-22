Improvement in practical week 6
1. the_effect_of_paternal_age_on_offspring_health.py
  To address the problem that I did not print frequency table that matches 
the input when the input table is changed, I added a for loop which can store
the matching paternal age and risk into a dictionary, then printed the 
dictionary.

2. marks.py
  To address the problem that I did not print a stored list of marks, I 
added an "input" to input the another set of eight practical marks, found 
all the numbers in the input string and stored them into a new list, then 
printed the list.
